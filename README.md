##About AirBnb
Airbnb is an online platform or can be said as an online marketplace that helps people to rent out their spare rooms or guest rooms or whole apartments to tourists or other visitors visiting in a city. Airbnb (ABNB) helps in connecting the people who want to rent out their homes with the people who are looking for a place to stay in specific regions. The company provides hosts an easy way to earn some income from their property. Airbnb is also considered having cheaper rentals and homier rooms than hotels. Particularly, the company's revenue is generated by charging fees to both guests and hosts.
##History of AirBnb
The American San Francisco-based company was started in 2007. The original idea for Airbnb came out when the company's co-founders Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia were striving hard to pay their rent. During that time, both of them noticed that due to a local industrial design conference, the surrounding hotels in San Francisco were completely booked up. That's when they came up with an innovative idea to make some additional money. Consequently, they put down three air mattresses and provided a bed and some breakfast to the designers who were in need of a place to stay during the conference. This motivated Chesky and Joe Gebbia to built their own site called airbedandbreakfast.com in 2008. AirBedandBreakfast.com is the original name of the company. Now, the company is one of the most well-known company for short-term housing rentals.
##About the project
This is an Exploratory data analysis (EDA) project. In this project, I will have to explore, load and analyse the AirBnb data to discover several key understandings and list out certain assumptions based on the data. This project will help us to understand and learn from the assumptions made. The project will also showcase the site traffic differences and also differences in the growth of the company. Accordingly, the dataset comprises the bookings made in New York City. It contains 48895 rows and 16 columns along with some categorical and numeric values. With the help of this dataset, data visualizations like graphs and charts will be shown in the project and these charts will be referred to make some meaningful assumptions about the project. Furtherly, data manipulation, testing, aggregation and many other operations will be explained in the project.
