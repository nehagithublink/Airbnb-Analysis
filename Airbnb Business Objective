Problem Statement:

Data analysis on millions of listings conferred through Airbnb is one of the most pivotal factor for the company. These listings produces a lot of data. This data then can be analysed and can be utilized for business decisions, understanding of customers and hosts behaviour and performance on the platform, security purposes, finding market strategies and much more. Hence, one of the most important task for me is to clean, test and manipulate the Airbnb dataset for analysis and providing some of the best perceptions for Airbnb business.
